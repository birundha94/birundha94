## **About Me**
- *Hi, I'm Birundha. I graduated in 2016 and initially worked in a non-IT field. After taking a career break to focus on my family, including raising my child, I completed a one-year internship in integration development. I am currently pursuing a full stack course at Scaler Academy, where I am enhancing my problem-solving skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), as well as gaining proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am passionate about transitioning into the IT industry and am committed to continuous learning, with plans to delve into Low-Level Design (LLD) and High-Level Design (HLD) in the future. I am eager for opportunities that allow me to grow my career and contribute effectively.*
